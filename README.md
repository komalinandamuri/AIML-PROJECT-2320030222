# Alzheimer's Detection 

This is a brain detection, website where you can post your MRI scans to check if u have Alzheimer's disease or not. 
We used Python CNN's (Convolutional neural network) deep learing to build this site. This is still a work in progress.
This project is done due to my AIML course in a short time for our expo so, yeah Thank you for taking a look at my project!
